1. Get touch id flow optimized
2. Add powersync to sync local encrypted data to supabase database for mobile and web cross platform compatability (users on mobile/web unlock data with the master password, the supabase account system is used to only give the proper user their data. supabase login + sync should be an option to connect in settings AFTER initial app set up locally)
3. get core AI functionality working for taking in chat and responding (set up openrouter idc about local llama right now but local fall back will be very important for offline)
4. get hot key pop up to instantly write words working
5. getting ghost in here and making the UI pretty

what core AI functionality will instantly help my life:
- the ability for me to yap ANYTHING into it, especially notes/journaling, to automatically save, store and organize for me
- google calendar connection for helping me with my schedule (read and add to it) 
- reminders (can do in app notifcations + telegram for mobile for now then upgrade to mobile app)
